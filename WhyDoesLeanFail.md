> The most
striking fact is the absence of even one
strategic action that addresses profitability,
return-on-investment, or shareholder value.
Lean is being viewed as a cost-reduction strategy,
not as a market domination one, by the majority of
companies

Granted the next Quote is qualified shortly after saying that these reasons are not just failure if lean. Its the indemic way businesses set themselves up to protect their mortgages rather than dominate the market.


>-  Lack of management support
- Resistance to change (lack of buy-in) from
supervision and workforce
- Poor metrics
- Not enough training
- Little or no impact on profitability
- Ineffective communications
- Not able to sustain initial efforts
- Not expanding improvement from the initial
efforts to other departments
- Improvements in one area seemed to have
negative impacts in others

There are other reasons, sure as JIT supply lines being hard to get right because it requies suppolier buy in. That could be an analogy for development teams not getting buyin from the rest of the company. But lean is meant to be a company wide strategy - of course it would fail in that situation. To start lean you need company wide buyin because its a strategy.


>they will quickly realize that growth
enabling strategies should be the standard
approach to a Lean initiative.

and ...

>Rather than viewing Lean primarily as a costreduction
tool, the best-in-class Strategic Actions
of a Lean initiative should contain two key
components: Customer Value and Business
Value, combining “purposes” into a powerful
Strategic Action



| Customer Value | Business Value |
|----------------|----------------|
| Decreased cost-per-unit | to support aggressive sales strategies |
| Lowered cost of product customization | to outperform competition at comparable price points |
| Decreased time-to-market of new products from concept to release | to establish market stronghold and “set the bar” for expectations |
| Decreased time-to-profit for new products though faster product development | to produce “on demand” as a competitive advantage |
| Increased throughput, reducing cost-perunit through higher  productivity/efficiency levels | to deliver higher revenues with existing resources |


Then there are a list of priorities and questions to answer for devising a strategy. Although how to convert the answers into one is not directly discussed.
